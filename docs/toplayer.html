                     <p> 
                        It was on a dreary night of November
                        that I beheld <span style="display:none">
                           the frame on whic</span> 
                        my man comple<span style="display:none">te</span>ated<span style="display:none">.</span>,
                        <span style="display:none">And</span>
                        with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony I collected instruments of life
                        around me <span style="display:none">and
                           endeavour to</span>
                        that I might
                        <span style="display:none">e</span>
                        infuse a
                        spark of being into the lifeless thin<span style="display:none">k</span>g
                        that lay at my feet. It was already
                        one in the morning, the rain pattered
                        dismally against the window panes, &amp;
                        my candle was nearly burnt out, when
                        by the glimmer of the half
                        extinguished light I saw the dull yellow eye of
                        the creature
                        open<span style="display:none">.</span>
                        —It breathed hard,
                        and a convulsive motion agitated
                        its limbs.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <span style="display:none">But how</span> How can I
                        describe my
                        emotion at this catastrophe; or how delineate the wretch whom with such
                        infinite pains and care I had endeavoured
                        to form. His limbs were in proportion
                        and I had selected his features <span style="display:none">h</span> as
                        <span style="display:none">handsome</span>
                        <span style="display:none">handsome</span>
                        beautiful. 
                        <span style="display:none">Handsome</span>
                        Beautiful; Great God! His
                        <span style="display:none">dun</span>
                        yellow skin
                        scarcely covered the work of
                        muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
                        was of a lustrous black
                        &amp; flowing and his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these
                        luxuriancies
                        only <span style="display:none">fomed</span>
                        formed a more horrid contrast with his watry eyes that seemed almost of 
                        the same colour as the dun white 
                        sockets in which they were set,
